graph
===

`graph` is a simple directed cyclic graph database, built specifically for two
use-cases:

1. Traversing the graph from a known starting node.
2. Finding the shorted path between two known nodes.

Nodes are assigned internal, sequential IDs, but can each hold any number of
arbitrary properties.

`graph` uses a simple text-based protocol.
